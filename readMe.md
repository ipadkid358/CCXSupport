## CCXSupport

Tweak for iOS 10 to natively add Control Center toggles. Adds the native Screen Recorder module to the shortcuts, and support for FlipSwitches

### TODOs

- Preferences
    - Set order for all availible switches (FlipSwitches, native, native additions) (possible to do at runtime by dragging?)
    - Set color for switches (again, would awesome to do from SpringBoard)
- Support for native addition toggles
- Possible support for multiple pages (may be difficult to do- requires research)
- Possibly add support for shortcut area as well
